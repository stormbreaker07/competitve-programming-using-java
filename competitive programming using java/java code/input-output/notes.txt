serializable and transient;
serialization mainly use to store object in files.
it stores data in non human readable format.
it is legacy in java lanquage.
found in java 1.1.
use to do serialize a file to see the data of object in the file.
it is a markdown interface.
that means it is an empty interface.
serializable interface is mandatory to be implement by file need to be serialized.
not used anymore.
String is Serializable ,all primitive type are Serializable.
String implements serializable interface.
if a class doesnt implement serializable but it super class implements serializable interface then,
keep in mind that it will also serializable.

serialversionUID it is id assign to data object data when write on a file so if u assign the data
to some other object type it can tell you with InvalidClassException that it class object is different. 


transient is use as modifier to stop any instance or parameter to not been store in file.
it will not bee seen after deserializing the object.
